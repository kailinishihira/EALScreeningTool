# Hawaii Environmental Action Level Screening Tool

#### By _Kaili Nishihira_

#### _A web app to screen analytical data from environmental samples against the State of Hawaii's established screening criteria, which are known as the Environmental Action Levels, 02.08.18_


## Description

_The use of this web app is for Environmental Consultants who conduct site investigations on properties throughout the State of Hawaii. Environmental Action Levels (EALs) are concentrations of contaminants in soil, soil gas, groundwater and indoor air that are used in decision making throughout the site investigation process._

_The user may create an account to access the web app. The user may create a new project and assign the Site Scenario's three criteria which are: Land Use, Groundwater Utility, and Distance to Nearest Surface Water Body. The user may enter each sample's contaminate results and compare it to the state established EAL._

_For more information on EALs, visit the  [State of Hawaii, Dept. of Health](http://eha-web.doh.hawaii.gov/eha-cma/Leaders/HEER/environmental-hazard-evaluation-and-environmental-action-levels)._

### User Stories

* _As a user, I would like to be able to store my sample data in the database._
* _As an administrator, I would like to be able to edit and delete sample data from the database._
* _As a user, I would like to filter sample results by a given contaminant so I may see how the contaminant concentrations vary throughout the site._
* _As a user, I would like to filter sample results by a given contaminant that exceeds the corresponding EAL, so that I may notify the client of the site areas that may need cleanup._
